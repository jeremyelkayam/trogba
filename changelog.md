## v2.0 : Troghammer Update

### New features
- Starting the game now brings you to the main menu. Here, you can see details on your last save, view high scores, and edit game options.
- The old instructions screen from the original Flash game has been removed. Instead, the new "How to play" mode fills this instructional purpose.
- To accommodate for this change, the Konami code entry from the original game has been moved to the title screen. It now permanently unlocks the option to start at 30 lives, so that you don't have to enter the code every time you want to use the 30 lives cheat. 
- The Troghammer from Trogdor: The Board Game has been added. If you take too long to complete a level, the Troghammer shows up to wreck house.
  - After your first death or finishing your first burnination (whichever comes first), the troghammer will be alerted. From here, he will slowly get closer and you will periodically receive alerts on his status until he arrives. 
  - The Troghammer has the same behavior as a knight, but he moves faster and further. Additionally, his hammer reaches further than the knights' swords.
- New options menu provides settings to alter the experience to player's desired difficulty level.
  - Options included are: Troghammer on/off, Trogmeter depreciation (lose trogmeter when peasants return home) on/off, starting lives, music/sfx volume. 
- Pausing during gameplay now brings up a menu in which you can alter settings, view high scores, or quit.
- Added a notification to the IT'S OVER! screen if the player has made it onto the high scores list. 
- The IT'S OVER! screen can show a new, even cooler secret thing if you get a really high score. 
- Added a prompt to the LEVEL BEATEN! scene telling the player to press A after the animation has played.
- Kicking the machine at certain times might unlock a secret 

### Changes and tweaks 
- The LEVEL BEATEN! scene can now be skipped earlier. 
- Removed default high scores list. 
- Save format has been changed. Existing saves will be erased upon booting v2.0. 
- Peasant and archer spawn rates have been adjusted. 
- Hitboxes have been adjusted to help mitigate instances where Trogdor would get hit by archers/knights despite not touching them. 

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the game would crash occasionally after spending too long entering your name in the high scores. 
- Fixed a crash that would happen after finishing the game (I think it's safe to say that exactly 0 people saw this one)
- Fixed a bug where values that were supposed to be random sometimes weren't random
- In rare instances, Strong Bad would talk over himself. This has been fixed
- Removed Large Bean
