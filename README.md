# Trogba
My first attempt at making a GBA game. Using game engine *Butano*. Hopefully I can get a version of Trogdor up and running on gba.

## What is this?
Partially inspired by that unfinished GBA port of Awexome Cross, and those DS homebrew ports of Secret Collect and Poptire. Also inspired by the fact that I got a GBA everdrive recently, just in time to miss the submission deadline for the [2022 GBA jam](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22).

## Release date
Who the heck knows! I'm not done yet but if you want to play the unfinished version you can build it from source. Maybe by Trogday 2023 I'll have something to show.
