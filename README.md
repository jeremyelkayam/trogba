# Trogba
My first attempt at making a GBA game. Using game engine *Butano*. Hopefully I can get a version of Trogdor up and running on gba.

## What is this?
Partially inspired by that unfinished GBA port of Awexome Cross, and those DS homebrew ports of Secret Collect and Poptire... I'm making that old flash game Trogdor for the Game Boy Advance. Also inspired by the fact that I got a GBA everdrive recently, just in time to not be able to submit anything for the [2022 GBA jam](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22). 

## Releases

### NO RELEASES YET
So I'm not actually done with this jame. But if you want to play the unfinished version right now, you can [build it from source](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/getting_started.html) using the Butano docs. Maybe by Trogday 2023 I'll have something to show.
