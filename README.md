# Trogba (a.k.a. Trogdor for GBA)
Remember that game [Trogdor](https://old.homestarrunner.com/trogdor-canvas/) from like 2003 or so? Well, have you ever wanted to play it on a console that was actually out in 2003? Such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance? No, you don't care and think it's a stupid idea? Well, as a great man once said, when have I ever backed down from a bad idea, right? So I made Trogdor on the GBA

## What is Trogba, and ... why? 
Partially inspired by (that unfinished GBA port of Awexome Cross)[https://pdroms.de/files/nintendo-gameboyadvance-gba/awexome-cross], and (those DS homebrew ports of Secret Collect and Poptire)[https://www.mrphlip.com/ds/]... I'm making that old flash game Trogdor for the Game Boy Advance. Also inspired by the fact that I got a GBA Everdrive recently, just in time to not be able to submit anything for the [2022 GBA jam](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22).
